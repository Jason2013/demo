Ok this solved it for me

if you’ve got IIS configured try this:

Run “dcomcnfg” to get to Component Services
Open Component Services > Computers > My Computer > DCOM Config
Search for Microsoft Excel Application or the appropriate application you working with on COM
Right-Click on it and open the properties
Choose “Identity” tab
Normally this is set to “the launching user” by default. You have to change this to “the interactive user”.
Apply these new settings and test your COM application. It should work fine now.
